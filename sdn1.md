# SDN

Software defined networking is not Everything , Everytime , for Everyone. Everybody likes a holygrail, a single solution to solves
their entire problems, but get dissapointed when it does not. Recently I came across a paper where it dealt with the idea of looking
at SDN controller as application platform and talks n shows work about a mediation layer which can arbitrate the coflicting rules imposed
by the by the applications. While this is one way of seeing the SDN, it again is not the holy grail, it only deals with the arbitration at
the controller level, but there can be several other controllers running applications with conflicting rules. So where should the arbitration
be at the controller or switch, so you can say switch with the earlier problem I mentioned, but is that it, another goal of SDN is keep the 
switches dumb , as dub as possible. So again , its not a holy grail of solutions.
